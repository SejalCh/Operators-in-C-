# Operators-in-C-

##**AIM**:To study about arithmetic operators in C++.

##**Theory**:

<p> Operators are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations on the operands. They are certain symbols which perform arithmetic operations such as <br>
addition, subtraction,etc. on operands(variable/constants. Arithmetic operators supported by C++ are: <br>
1.'+'-add<br>
2.'-'-subtract<br>
3.'*'-multiply<br>
4.'/'-division<br>
5.'%'-modulo operation</p>

<p>There also other operators supported by C++ like bitwise,relational, logical etc., which we will discuss later.</p>

##**OUTPUT**:
